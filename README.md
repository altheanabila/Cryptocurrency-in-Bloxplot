# Cryptocurrency-in-Bloxplot-and-Linegraph

I try to visualize closing price of cryptocurrency, using Python libraries, such as : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, box plot and line graph could be created and with inherent descritive statistics.

1. First of all, download daily historical data from yahoo finance for each cryptocurrency for 1 year, And sort the data into 1 file excel.

2. extracting excel data into pandaframes:

4. Using the command: import plotly.express as px you can see the descriptive analytics of each stock in that looks user friendly.
